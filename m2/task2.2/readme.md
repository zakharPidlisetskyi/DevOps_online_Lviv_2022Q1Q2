I created, launch and terminate my first instance in EC2. Created two backups by snapshot and AWS Backup. Backup which created by AWS Backup was removed.
After launch second instance and attaching Disk_D, I can remove snapshot which used for creating this instance. In MobaXterm I connected to my instance and
set up attached disk for using in the centos system, because this volume didn't have filesystem, so I configured it and mounted the disk as /data directory.
